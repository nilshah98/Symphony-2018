    <h1>About KJSCE</h1>
    <p>
    Set in the heart of Mumbai, KJSCE is located in the Somaiya Vidyavihar campus. With a total of 34 institutions in its 65 acre campus, Somaiya Vidyavihar has become an educational hub. Since its establishment in 1983, KJSCE has grown in leaps and bounds. Boasting of a huge campus and state of the art facilities KJSCE has surpassed many of its contemporaries and presented itself as one of the premier engineering colleges in Mumbai. And with another feather in its cap in the form of being the only self financed Engineering College to be granted autonomous status whilst maintaining its affiliation to the University of Mumbai.</p>
